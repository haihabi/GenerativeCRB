This respostoy contins a python package that compute the Generative Cram\'er-Rao Bound given a Condtional Normalzing Flow. In addtions, this respostoy contins a set of four example on various type of signal processing examples.
## Abstract 
The Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB), a well-known lower bound on the performance of any unbiased parameter estimator, has been used to study a wide variety of problems. However, to obtain the CRB,  requires an analytical expression for the likelihood of the measurements given the parameters, or equivalently a precise and explicit statistical model for the data. In many applications, such a model is not available.  Instead, this work introduces a novel approach to approximate the CRB using data-driven methods, which removes the requirement for an analytical statistical model. This approach is based on the recent success of deep generative models in modeling complex, high-dimensional distributions. Using a learned normalizing flow model, we model the distribution of the measurements and obtain an approximation of the CRB, which we call Generative Cram\'er-Rao Bound (GCRB). Numerical experiments on simple problems validate this approach,  and experiments on two image processing tasks of image denoising and edge detection with a learned camera noise model demonstrate its power and benefits.
